            <p>I seem to be off the track of technical posts for a while, sorry about that, coz currently I am on a biz trip in US. And what I did daily over the past month was taste testing on all kinds of snacks, drinks and of course burgers which was, are not available in China.[ Not sure if it will be in the future. :) ]</p>
<p>Alright, Shake Shack has been known for ages, but it was into my world approximately a year ago on which I happened to see a Vlog at YouTube introducing ShakeShack food testing. Then I put it into my food backlog. So this time when I get a chance to come here, I think it’s ready for my tongue buds to kiss this <code>delight</code>.</p>
<p>So yesterday, I was en route to Apple Store at Pentagon City, to pick up iphoneXs for my colleagues. Btw, it’s really a long queue, tons of ppl waited in the line. And things went worse when their crappy system was down, no transaction could be done until the system went back. Luckily, after a long time of waiting, I finally nailed it. Mission completed.</p>
<p>After that, I jumped into Shake Shack store in the same mall, and just ordered a Shackburger for a testing. I know their milk shake is a <code>dynamite</code> as well. But I gave it up since my yesterday’s calorie intake exceeded my daily standard. Meanwhile, the reason why I didn’t order their fries is I prefer hand cut fries like Caliburger’s, or curly fries which look cute.</p>

<p><img src="/images/shakeshack-receipt.jpeg"><br><img src="/images/back-of-shakeshack-receipt.jpeg"><br>A single Shackburger is $5.59 before tax. I ordered two :). For those of you who eat a lot for a meal, you need three or add up some side dishes coz the portion of one burger is not big in Shake Shack.</p>

<p><strong>My Point Of View</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h6 id="The-Juice"><a href="#The-Juice" class="headerlink" title="The Juice"></a>The Juice</h6><p>Well, right off the bat, the first bite seemed nothing amazing. What I expected was beef’s juice exploding in my mouth. Maybe it exploded, but at least not strong enough for my tongue buds to react. Or probably my tongue buds retarded since I had so much flaming hot doritos/cheetos lately.<br>But wait, things changed when I chewed them slowly in my mouth. It’s a beef patty that hid all flavours inside. It’s not tantalizing in the surface, but it wrapped all essence in its heart. The harder you chewed, more juice came out. Its juice was not a strong flavour, actually it’s more like bland, but you could feel that its quality was at a higher level than the average. Coz my tongue buds could taste the natural beef fragrance without too much efforts, it’s storming right towards you, overwhelmingly. And the juice even became better when it streamed through your tongue and down your throat. It’s just like your whole digestive system was immersed into a beefy world.</p>
<h6 id="Beef-patty-in-general"><a href="#Beef-patty-in-general" class="headerlink" title="Beef patty in general"></a>Beef patty in general</h6><p>And the beef in general was nice. Its texture was so soft that it’s already melted in my mouth before I put more “chewing” on it. But personally speaking, I don’t think this is everyone’s delight as its taste, flavour is quite bland, lacking a strong sense which you usually meet when you take a stake. So if you’re a strong flavour person, pls ignore this test report, I don’t think that’s your style.</p>
<h6 id="The-others"><a href="#The-others" class="headerlink" title="The others"></a>The others</h6><p>Apart from their beef patty, the ornamental ingredients were also good. Especially Shake Shack sauce and its cheese. They complemented the whole very well by adding cheesy flavour in it. I don’t know which cheese it is and what their special sauce is made out of, but they kinda sorta of balance the whole thing out. It’s like dipping the beef patty into a strong and still flavourful sauce, and presenting the whole to your tongue buds. The beefiness, the cheesiness, the freshness, <strong><code>oh man, that&#39;s heaven</code>.</strong></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<h5 id="End"><a href="#End" class="headerlink" title="End"></a><strong>End</strong></h5><p>To sum it up, it’s not the one I imagined before I tested. But it was not a bad experience. For ppl in team #light-flavour, it’s a go-to burger you should try.</p>
